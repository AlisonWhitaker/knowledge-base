The repository contains:
--> The results of the pairwise linking of the different DOREMUS bases (EDOAL alignment files).
--> The resulting pivot graph. Work in progress: the current pivot graph file contains only the certain links (see "infos-linking" document for more details).
--> Detailed description of the linking strategies, results, errors and statistics in the "infos-linking-2018-02-14.txt" document.
