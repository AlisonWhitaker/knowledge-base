Storing alignments of vocabularies in the knowledge base. 

Work in progress: The folders 'mop' and 'genre' contains the final versions of the alignments of mops and genres related vocabulaires, respectively. They may contain alignments produced previously with earlier versions of the vocabularies (check the resepctive readme's). Note that 'genre' contains a manually created mapping between iaml and rameau.

Work in progress: The 'validateWorkplace' folder contains the automatically produced and expert validated alignments.
