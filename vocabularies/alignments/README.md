Storing alignments of vocabularies in the knowledge base. 

Work in progress: The 'validateWorkplace' folder contains the automatically produced and expert validated alignments.

Work in progress: The folders 'mop' and 'genre' will contain the final versions of the alignments of mops and genres related vocabulaires, respectively. They may contain alignments produced previously with earlier versions of the vocabularies. Note that 'genre' contains a manually created mapping between iaml and rameau.
