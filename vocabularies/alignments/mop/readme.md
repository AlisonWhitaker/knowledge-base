This folder contains the final expert validated version of the alignments of the MOP vocabularies.


All alignments contained in the SKOS folder are old version and should not be taken into consideration. This folder contains alignments of MoP vocabulaires produced on September 20, 2016 in SKOS (simple triples) format.

The used versions of the vocabularies (as of 20 septembre 2016) are: 

IAML:

MIMO:

Note that two alignements exist per pair of ontologies and format: one from A to B and another from B to A (with A and B two vocabularies), the alignment process being asymetrique.
