This folder contains the final expert validated versions of the alignments of the MOP vocabularies. 

----NB:
All alignments contained in the "SKOS-format" folder are old versions (should not be taken into consideration). This folder contains alignments of MoP vocabulaires produced on September 20, 2016 in SKOS (simple triples) format. Note that two alignements exist per pair of ontologies: one from A to B and another from B to A (with A and B two vocabularies), the alignment process being asymetrique.
