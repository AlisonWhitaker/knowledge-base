Alignments of MoP vocabulaires. Two formats of the alignments: EDOAL ("OAEI" format) and SKOS (simple triples).
The aligned versions of vocabularies (as of 20 septembre 2016) are:

MIMO:

Note that two alignements exist per pair of ontologies and format: one from A to B and another from B to A (with A and B two vocabularies), the alignment process being asymetrique.
